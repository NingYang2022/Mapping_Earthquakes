# Mapping Earthquakes

## <font color=#6495ED>Overview of Project</font>
Disaster Reporting Network is a non-profit company that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world. Our mission will be to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes. We hope that making earthquake maps informative and easy on desktop and mobile phones will generate positive buzz about Disaster Reporting Network

### <font color=#6495D>Purposes</font>

1. Traverse and retrieve  the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from U.S. Geological Survey website, using JavaScript, D3 and leaflet libraries.

2. Plot the data on Maxbox map through an API request. There will be 3 map styles: street, satellite and dark.

3. On the map, the magnitude and location of each earthquake will be shown in a popup marker.

4. The diameter of the markers for each earthquake will reflect the magnitude in their size and color

5. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color.

6. A Legend will provide context for the map data.

7. To illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity, fault lines of tectonic plates will be added on the map

## <font color=#6495ED>Results</font>
-  We created earthquake map with three different maps: street, satellite and dark.

- We added three overlays to the map: all earthquakes, major earthquakes and tectonic plates .

- the magnitude and location of each earthquake are shown in a popup marker.
- The diameter of the markers for each earthquake reflects the magnitude in their size and color
- A Legend provides context for the map data.
